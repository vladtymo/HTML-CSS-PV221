    <h1>Working with CSS Preprocessors</h1>
    <p>
        A <strong>CSS preprocessor</strong> is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique
        syntax. There are
        many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in
        pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Sass</strong> is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the
        world.</p>
